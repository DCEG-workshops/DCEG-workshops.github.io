## What you will learn

During the workshop, participants will receive an overview of FAIR principles and we will demonstrate how storing your data in Box and integrating RStudio with Box promotes FAIR research. Attendees will practice the simple steps that are needed to integrate RStudio with their Box account to 
read data into RStudio directly from Box
save data and output directly to Box from RStudio
take advantage of versioning control
We will also teach attendees how to control access to their data stored in Box. 
Â 
This is the first in a series of hands-on workshops for teaching and promoting FAIR research practices. Topics of future workshops include Using GitHub and Data Harmonization.

Attendees will practice the simple steps that are needed to integrate RStudio with their Box account to read data into RStudio directly from Box save data and output directly to Box from RStudio take advantage of versioning control We will also teach attendees how to control access to their data stored in Box. This is the first in a series of hands-on workshops for teaching and promoting FAIR research practices. Topics of future workshops include Using GitHub and Data Harmonization.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2351e072301cec1afe97f55397b47760","permalink":"https://dceg-workshops.github.io/course/fair-workshop/01_r_box/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/course/fair-workshop/01_r_box/","section":"course","summary":"Date: April 20, 2022 \n","tags":null,"title":"Using RStudio with Box","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Date: To be announced \nInstructors: Jeya Balaji Balasubramanian\n","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"4ed442f34c5c48d8fcf1262ebf54c8c5","permalink":"https://dceg-workshops.github.io/course/fair-workshop/02_github/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/course/fair-workshop/02_github/","section":"course","summary":"Date: To be announced \n","tags":null,"title":"Using GitHub","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Date: To be announced \nInstructors: Nicole Gerlanc\n","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"d895d58da12874b99b2352da581ee833","permalink":"https://dceg-workshops.github.io/course/fair-workshop/03_data_harmonizations/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/course/fair-workshop/03_data_harmonizations/","section":"course","summary":"Date: To be announced \n","tags":null,"title":"Data Harmonization","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"We are happy to announce the first DCEG FAIR principles workshop on using R with Box\nFAIR principles workshop using R with Box\n","date":164808e4,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":164808e4,"objectID":"d7500ad2856586668fbe9a567bd75d97","permalink":"https://dceg-workshops.github.io/post/22-03-24-fair-workshop-announcement/","publishdate":"2022-03-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/22-03-24-fair-workshop-announcement/","section":"post","summary":"We are happy to announce the first DCEG FAIR principles workshop on using R with Box\n","tags":null,"title":"FAIR workshop on using R with Box","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Here\u0026rsquo;s a list of other workshops/courses available\n Data Carpentry Genomics Workshop Intro to Reproducibility in Cancer Informatics Bioinformatics Training and Education Program ","date":1645660800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1645660800,"objectID":"23536bf0de9471d371d6468c8ac665d0","permalink":"https://dceg-workshops.github.io/post/22-02-24-opensource-workshops/","publishdate":"2022-02-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/22-02-24-opensource-workshops/","section":"post","summary":"Here\u0026rsquo;s a list of other workshops/courses available\n","tags":null,"title":"List of opensource workshops available","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://dceg-workshops.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
